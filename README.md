# SimQuantGeneticsDemo
This project aims to explain how quantitative genetics works to support breeding decisions in crops.
To do so, I use AlphaSimR to simulate populations, conduct analysis with mixed linear models, and visualize the results.
I hope these could let students/workshop attenders to better understand the abstract concept and the role of quantitative genetics in breeding.

The folders in this repo:
- `R`: the R scripts used for this project
- `doc`: some documentation
- `fig`: figures generated from the data analysis
