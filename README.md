# SimQuantGeneticsDemo
This is a private project inspired by some breeders I've worked with. 

This project aims to explain how quantitative genetics works to support breeding decisions in crops.
To do so, we use AlphaSimR to simulate populations, conduct analysis with mixed linear models, and visualize the results.
I hope these could let anyone interested in this topic/plant breeding students better understand the concept and the role of quantitative genetics in breeding.

Also, this project has served as my notebook to organize the knowledge learned from the excellent materials and literature written by those great scientists in the field.

The folders in this repo:
- `R`: the R scripts used for this project
- `doc`: documentation
- `fig`: figures generated from the data analysis
