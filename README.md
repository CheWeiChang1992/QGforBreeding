# Quantitative Genetics for breeding
This is a private project inspired by some breeders I've worked with. 

This self-study project aims to figure out how quantitative genetics can support breeding decisions in crop breeding.
To do so, I use AlphaSimR to simulate populations, conduct analysis with mixed linear models, and visualize the results.
Also, I want to use open data/simulated data to try out some cool tools, such as BGLR, bWGR, and MegaLMM, also some ideas for breeding.

this project has served as my notebook to organize the knowledge learned from the excellent materials and literature written by those great scientists in the field.

The folders in this repo:
- `R`: the R scripts used for this project
- `doc`: documentation
- `fig`: figures generated from the data analysis
